# DKT-Stereo: Robust Synthetic-to-Real Transfer for Stereo Matching
This is the official repository for our CVPR 2024 paper: Robust Synthetic-to-Real Transfer for Stereo Matching.

paper: [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07705)]

## Introduction
We aim to fine-tune stereo networks without compromising robustness to unseen domains. We identify that learning new knowledge without sufficient regularization and overfitting GT details can degrade the robustness. We propose the DKT framework, which improves fine-tuning by dynamically measuring what has been learned.
